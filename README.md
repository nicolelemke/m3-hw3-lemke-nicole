Assignment 3 - MIC 6278

## Issues
I didn't have any large iddues doing this assigment. I was a bit unsure how to utilize LESS for responsivness. For me using less took way more time then it usually takes me to code something. It seems more confusing to me at the moment. Like an extra step that is kind of just in the way. I'm sure as I use it maybe it will get easier and faster.
